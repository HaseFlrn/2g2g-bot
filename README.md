# 2g2g-bot

## Problem

I love to use the [2good2go-app](https://https://toogoodtogo.com/en-us). The only problem that troubles me,  is that yoou won't get notified when your favourite stores have restocked.

## Solution

I use the [2good2go Python library](https://pypi.org/project/tgtg/) to get notified via Telegram (more might follow).
